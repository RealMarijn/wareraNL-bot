"""Slash command /fabrieken — company counts per item and country.

Reads the hourly company census written by :mod:`services.full_fetcher` into
``database/external.db`` (tables ``company_census`` / ``company_census_runs``).
The command makes no WarEra API calls at all: the sweep already visits every
company in the game once an hour and stores counts for *every* country × item
pair, so answering any of the four views below is one indexed SELECT.

Views, chosen by which arguments are supplied:

===============  ==========================================================
Arguments        Shows
===============  ==========================================================
item + land      Companies and workers for that one combination
item only        Every country producing that item, ranked
land only        Every item produced in that country, ranked
neither          Top 10 countries and top 10 items, by company count
eigenaren=True   Largest owners, scoped by whichever filters were given
===============  ==========================================================

Whenever ``land`` is given (and ``eigenaren`` isn't), a "By region" table is
added showing how many companies that country has in each of its regions —
from ``company_owner_map``'s ``region_id`` column and the ``region_snapshots``
name lookup, both populated by the same company-census sweep, so this costs
no extra API calls either.

Two modifiers apply on top:
  * ``alles=True`` prints the full owner list across several messages instead
    of the top 25.
  * ``met_werknemers=True`` counts only companies that have at least one
    worker, and drops owners who have none.  This needs the ``staffed_count``
    column, because "how many companies have a worker" cannot be derived from
    a total company count plus a total worker count.

Owner names are resolved from ``citizen_levels`` (also filled by the fetcher),
so the owner view stays API-free too.  An owner the citizen sweep has not
recorded is rendered as a profile link rather than dropped.

A company counts towards a country when the region it sits in is currently
controlled by that country.  That mapping is re-evaluated by every sweep, so a
region changing hands is reflected within the hour.

The 7-day delta is shown only once history reaches back that far; until then the
command says so rather than showing a meaningless "+108".

Command name and argument names stay Dutch (``/fabrieken item: land: eigenaren:
alles: met_werknemers: belasting_per_land: sinds:``) to match the rest of this
guild's command surface; all *output* (titles, descriptions, table contents,
error messages) is English. Item labels are therefore duplicated: the
Dutch ``ITEM_LABELS_NL`` / ``_item_label`` pair stays exactly as it was
because :mod:`nigeria_bot.productie` imports ``_item_label`` and still needs
Dutch output — this module's own views use the English ``ITEM_LABELS_EN`` /
``_item_label_en`` instead.
