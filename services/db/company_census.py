"""Database mixin for ``company_census`` / ``company_census_runs`` / ``region_snapshots``.

An hourly census of every company in the game, bucketed by the country that
currently controls the region the company sits in, and by the item it produces.
Written by :mod:`services.full_fetcher`; read by the Nigeria bot's
``/fabrieken`` command.

Storing counts for every (country, item) pair costs no extra API calls — the
sweep has to look at all ~73k companies regardless — which is what lets
``/fabrieken`` answer for any country × item combination without touching the
WarEra API.

``company_owners`` adds a per-owner breakdown from the very same
``company.getById`` responses (the owner ID was previously discarded), so it is
likewise free.  It keeps only the newest sweep — see
:meth:`CompanyCensusMixin.save_company_owners`.

``region_snapshots`` maps region id -> name/code/controlling country, from the
same ``region.getRegionsObject`` call already made to resolve each company's
country — see :meth:`CompanyCensusMixin.save_region_snapshots`. Paired with
the ``region_id`` column on ``company_owner_map`` (services/db/company_tax.py),
this is what lets ``/fabrieken`` break a country down by region by name.
