"""Weekly/daily damage history built from the hourly weeklyUserDamages ranking.

Two tables back everything here (see database/schema.sql):

``citizen_weekly_damage_history``
    One row per player per game week — a straight snapshot of the API's
    weekly damage counter.

``citizen_daily_damage``
    One row per player per game day.  The game does not expose a daily
    counter, so a day's damage is derived as ``weekly_end - baseline``:
    the weekly counter's value now, minus its value when the day opened.
    :meth:`DamageHistoryMixin.apply_weekly_damage_snapshot` maintains both.
