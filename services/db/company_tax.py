"""Database mixin for wage income-tax tracking.

Tables: ``worker_company_map``, ``country_tax_rates``, ``company_tax_revenue``,
``company_owner_map``.

A wage transaction from ``transaction.getPaginatedTransactions`` names only the
worker (``sellerId``) and the employer (``buyerId``) — never the company or the
item.  Tax is owed to the country the *company* sits in, so the attribution
chain is::

    wage.sellerId → worker_company_map → (company, country, item)
    tax = wage.money × country_tax_rates.income_tax / 100

``company_owner_map`` extends this chain one hop further, from a company to
its owner's *nationality*::

    company_tax_revenue.company_id → company_owner_map → owner_id → citizen_levels.country_id

which is what lets the Nigeria bot's ``/tax-breakdown`` command say "of the
tax generated in Nigeria, this much came from companies owned by Dutch
citizens" — a different question from "how much tax did Nigeria collect",
which ``company_tax_revenue.country_id`` alone already answers (and is what
``/fabrieken`` shows).

Written by :mod:`services.full_fetcher`, read by the Nigeria bot's
``/fabrieken`` and ``/tax-breakdown`` commands.
