"""Standalone hourly all-countries data fetcher.

Runs as a dedicated process (separate from the Discord bot and the website)
that wakes up every hour, performs a complete sweep of API data for every
country, and writes the results into the shared SQLite database.

Why a separate container?
    * Keeps the Discord bot's task loop lean (and its crashes out of the
      data pipeline).
    * Lets us tune the sweep cadence independently.
    * Single, predictable owner of the API rate budget for full sweeps.

What is fetched, in order, every hour:
    1. ``country.getAllCountries`` → master country list (writes
       ``country_snapshots`` with the latest production_bonus / specialized_item).
    2. For each country: every citizen's ``user.getUserLite`` →
       ``citizen_levels`` (via :class:`services.citizen_cache.CitizenCache`).
    3. A census of every company in the game → ``company_census``, bucketed by
       the country controlling its region and by the item it produces. The
       same pass also writes ``company_owner_map`` (company → owner, for
       every company seen), which is what lets tax revenue later be traced
       back to the owner's nationality.
    4. New wage transactions → ``company_tax_revenue``, the income tax paid to
       each country per company and item.
    5. Every alliance and its member countries → ``alliance_countries``, for
       the Nigeria bot's /damage-projection command. Health/hunger for that
       same command is captured as a side effect of step 2's citizen sweep
       (see ``citizen_combat_state`` in services/citizen_cache.py).
    6. Company owners missing from step 2 → backfilled by ID. Step 2 only
       learns citizen IDs via ``user.getUsersByCountry``, which silently
       omits inactive players (``isActive: false``) — see
       ``fetch_missing_owner_citizenships`` for how this was found and why a
       direct-by-ID fetch is the only way to close the gap.
    7. Every region's resistance (``region.getAll``) and base/bunker upgrade
       status (``upgrade.getUpgradeByTypeAndEntity``) → ``region_resistance``
       / ``region_upgrade_status``, for the extension's whitelisted
       ``/api/ext/regions/*`` endpoints (see ``fetch_region_status``).
    8. Proxy/puppet-country status from a third-party detection API (NOT
       WarEra's own) → ``country_proxy_status``, for the extension's
       whitelisted ``/api/ext/countries/proxy`` endpoint (see
       ``fetch_country_proxy_status``). No-op unless PROXY_API_URL/
       PROXY_API_KEY are configured.

Each sweep step records progress through
:meth:`services.db.Database.mark_started` / :meth:`mark_finished` under
descriptive dataset keys (``"all_countries.snapshots"``,
``"all_countries.citizens"``) so the website's /admin and /paraatheid pages
can show freshness.

Configuration via environment:
    FULL_FETCH_INTERVAL_MINUTES (default 60)
    FULL_FETCH_RUN_AT_STARTUP   (default 1; set to 0 to wait for the first
                                 interval before doing any work)
    FULL_FETCH_COUNTRY_LIMIT    (default 0 = unlimited; useful for smoke tests)
    RW_DB_PATH, RW_API_BASE_URL, RW_API_KEYS_PATH — same as the website.
    PROXY_API_URL, PROXY_API_KEY — third-party proxy-country detection
                                 service (step 8); step is skipped if unset.

async def fetch_company_census(client: APIClient, db: Database) -> int:
    """Census every company in the game, bucketed by controlling country + item.

    Three phases:
      1. Paginate ``company.getCompanies`` (no filter) for every company ID.
      1.5. Reconcile against a per-known-citizen ``company.getCompanies``
           (filtered by ``userId``) to recover companies phase 1 misses — see
           below for why that happens at all.
      2. Batch ``company.getById`` to read each company's region, itemCode and
         workerCount, mapping region → country via ``region.getRegionsObject``.

    A company belongs to the country that *currently controls* its region, so
    the mapping is re-read every sweep rather than cached.

    Phase 1's unfiltered listing was confirmed live to silently omit
    companies that unambiguously exist (via ``company.getById`` directly, and
    via the ``userId``-filtered form of the very same endpoint, which does
    return them). It appears to paginate by ``updatedAt``, and a periodic
    game-engine tick stamps huge numbers of companies with the exact same
    ``updatedAt`` down to the millisecond — precisely the condition under
    which timestamp-keyset pagination can silently skip rows between page
    fetches. Phase 1.5 closes that gap for any company whose owner this sweep
    already knows about (i.e. anyone in ``citizen_levels``), at the cost of
    one batched-per-100 request per known citizen — chosen over a cheaper
    "only known owners" variant so a company owned by someone who has never
    shown up as an owner before isn't missed on its first sweep either.

    The same responses also carry the owner ID, so a per-owner breakdown is
    written to ``company_owners`` for free — no extra requests.

    Companies listed in phase 1 can be sold or destroyed before phase 2 reads
    them, so ``checked`` is normally a little lower than ``listed``; both are
    recorded.

    A company the owner has switched off (confirmed live via
    ``company.getById``) keeps existing — it's still listed in phase 1 and
    still returns a full payload in phase 2 — but carries a ``disabledAt``
    timestamp that an active company never has. Companies owned by an
    inactive player (confirmed live via ``user.getUserLite``'s ``isActive``)
    are excluded the same way, on the theory the user gave for both: neither
    is "used anymore". Both kinds are counted in ``checked`` (their details
    were successfully fetched) but excluded from every bucket:
    ``company_census``, ``company_owners`` and ``company_owner_map`` all only
    ever see companies that were active, with an active owner, at scan time —
    so ``/fabrieken`` and ``/productie`` don't inflate their totals with dead
    companies.

    A banned *worker* gets the same treatment, one level down: a company
    counts as having a worker only if it has at least one worker who isn't
    banned (confirmed live via ``user.getUserLite``'s ``infos.isBanned`` —
    also confirmed to coexist with ``isActive: false`` on the same account,
    so a banned worker is not necessarily caught by the owner check above
    even when they are one elsewhere). This needs each staffed company's
    worker *roster*, not just its ``workerCount``, so — unlike the
    disabled/inactive-owner checks above, which only need the company payload
    itself — the worker-roster fetch (``worker.getWorkers``, already made
    below to build ``worker_company_map`` for tax attribution) now has to
    happen *before* a company's counts are finalized, not after.

    Both the owner-activity and worker-banned checks read
    ``citizen_levels.is_active`` / ``.is_banned``, populated by the citizen
    sweep this function's caller already ran earlier in the same
    ``run_once()`` pass — no extra API calls. Both can only catch citizens
    this sweep already knows about; a citizen never seen before is still
    counted once, the same one-sweep lag ``/productie`` already documents for
    citizenship attribution in general — closed by
    ``fetch_missing_owner_citizenships`` / ``fetch_missing_worker_citizenships``
    running right after this function, for the *next* sweep.

    Also writes ``region_snapshots`` (every region's id/code/name/controlling
    country, from the same ``region.getRegionsObject`` call above) and a
    ``region_id`` on each ``company_owner_map`` row, so ``/fabrieken`` can
    break a country's companies down by region — no extra API calls, since
    both were already being read to resolve each company's country.

    Returns the number of census rows written.
